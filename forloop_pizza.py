#09/07/2022 This is to train the for loop.

pizzas = ['chicken and catupity', 'corn', 'chicken and cheese']
for pizza in pizzas:
 print(pizza)

#Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.

pizzas = ['chicken and catupity', 'corn', 'chicken and cheese']
for pizza in pizzas:
 print(f"I like {pizza} pizza! \n")

print("I didn't like corn pizza before, but now it is one of my favorites. I also like chicken and cheese as well as chicken and catupity. I really love pizza!")
